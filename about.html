						<p>Transforms bullet journaling into a fully interactive digital and physical experience with a smart journal and an app</p>
					</header>

					<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/digital_planner.jpg" alt="" /></a>
					<p>We conducted our design research through semi-structured interviews with people who currently journal or used to journal but quit, diary studies with people who do not journal at all, and contextual inquiries with people who used to journal but have adapted their methods. Our goal was to understand how people viewed bullet journaling and how they practiced self-reflection and daily planning.					</p>
					<p>Each research method helped us narrow down our tasks and exposed both important and inconvenient aspects of bullet journaling. Our contextual inquiry showed that a paper journal forces people to flip back and forth while transferring information between pages. The diary studies indicated how people with limited experience with tracking and journaling approached the idea of bullet journaling. Our interview participants also modified their journaling methods over the years to suit their own schedules and comfort levels. Understanding participant perspectives regarding the hardships of a physical journal while still acknowledging the importance of a tactile experience helped us refine our thinking and approach.					</p>
					<p>While we initially considered converting the entire experience of bullet journaling to a digital form for greater accessibility and efficiency, we decided to maintain a physical aspect in our design based on our research findings. We found that the inconvenience of daily tracking was a major reason why people quit journaling, which encouraged us to consider alternate methods of interacting with the journal.</p>
					<p>We chose a hybrid design, a smart journal that is compatible with a multi-platform app. This provides people with efficiency and convenience while still allowing for a tactile experience and interaction. Our research participants emphasized the importance of writing things down, but also mentioned the significant overhead required for tracking and staying motivated to achieve their goals. A physical form allows people to slow down and visualize their schedules, making it easier to say no to commitments they cannot take on. Especially with many journalists facing busy schedules, we hope to reduce the amount of procedural and mindless tasks that are often associated with tracking, to both encourage participants to find time to practice mindfulness in their routines, and to make journaling accessible on any platform. We hope that our Pocket Planner design will empower people to be more mindful of their mental health.					</p>
